### About Me üöÄ

Hello! My name is Hannah. I am a Northeastern student currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Linguistics. I am a software developer at Code4Community, where I work with a team of developers to create software solutions for Boston nonprofits.

Last semester, I worked with a team of developers to revamp the organization's website to enhance user experience and boost engagement.<br/>

I‚Äôm currently working with Code4Community to modernize NEFAC's (New England First Amendment Coalition) website using modern front-end technologies (React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS). Additionally, we're implementing a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help users easily access information about the organization and its activities. <br>

I am interested in fullstack, frontend, or backend web development roles.
